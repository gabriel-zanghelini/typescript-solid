# TypeScript - SOLID Principles

Small project developed to learn the SOLID principles with TS. Section 25 of [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/curso-de-javascript-moderno-do-basico-ao-avancado/) course.

The project started with a Shopping Cart and was refactored following the SOLID principles along the section of the course.
